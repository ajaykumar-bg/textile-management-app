# GitHub Copilot Instructions for React and Next.js Projects

This file provides guidelines for GitHub Copilot to ensure consistent, clean, and performant code generation for React and Next.js applications.

## General Principles

- **Clean Code:** Prioritize **readability, maintainability, and reusability**.
- **Conciseness:** Aim for concise and expressive code.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, components, and files (e.g., `getUserProfile`, `ProductCard`, `useAuth`).
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract reusable logic into functions, custom hooks, or components.
- **Modularization:** Break down complex problems and features into smaller, manageable units (components, functions, utilities).
- **TypeScript First:** All new code should be written in **TypeScript**, leveraging its type safety features.
- **Testable Code:** Design code to be easily testable.
- **Package Management:** This project uses **pnpm** for managing dependencies. All package installations and scripts should use `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Documentation:** All principal documentation should be created in the `docs` folder.

### General Guidelines

- **Co-locate logic that change together**
- **Group code by feature, not by type**
- **Separate UI, logic, and data fetching**
- **Typesafety across the whole stack â€“ db-server-client. If a type changes, everywhere using it should be aware.**
- **Clear product logic vs product infrastructure separation**
- **Design code such that it is easy to replace and delete**
- **Minimize places/number of changes to extend features**
- **Functions / APIs should do one thing well. One level of abstraction per function**
- **Minimize API interface and expose only what's necessary**
- **Favor pure functions, it makes logic easy to test**
- **Long, clear names over short, vague names, even at the cost of verbosity**

## React Specific Guidelines

### Component Design

- **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer **functional components with React Hooks**. Avoid class components unless explicitly for error boundaries.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component should ideally have one primary responsibility. **Components should be kept small and focused.**
- **Component Naming:** Use `PascalCase` for all component names (e.g., `MyButton`, `UserAvatar`).
- **Props:**
  - Use `camelCase` for prop names.
  - Destructure props in the component's function signature.
  - Provide clear `interface` or `type` definitions for props in TypeScript.
- **Immutability:** Never mutate props or state directly. Always create new objects or arrays for updates.
- **Fragments:** Use `<>...</>` or `React.Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM wrapper elements.
- **Custom Hooks:** Extract reusable stateful logic into **custom hooks** (e.g., `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`).
- **UI Components:** Use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for building UI components to ensure consistency and accessibility.

### State Management

- **Local State:** Use `useState` for component-level state.
- **Global State:** For global or shared state, prefer **React Context API** or a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux, Jotai). Avoid prop drilling.
- Use the Context API for managing application-wide state, especially for data that needs to be accessible by many components without prop drilling

### Styling

- **Consistent Approach:** use Tailwind CSS v4 ou later.
- **Scoped Styles:** Ensure styles are scoped to avoid global conflicts.

### Performance

- **Keys:** Always provide a unique and stable `key` prop when mapping over lists. Do not use array `index` as a key if the list can change.
- **Declarations:** Utilize React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent components and functions from re-rendering or re-creating unnecessarily.
- **Lazy Loading:** Suggest `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code splitting large components or routes.

## Project Specific Guidelines

- Make sure to keep using Mui 7.3.2 Grid syntax to use size prop instead of deprecated item prop.
- Make sure to use @mui/x-charts 8.11.1 version while implementing charts.
- While creating a large page or component, create a folder and split into smaller components with index file containing the exports.
- Use centralized constants file to manage static data like chart data, table data, dropdown options etc.
- Use utils file inside component folder with {folder_name}.utils to manage helper functions.
